Founding and history
Carhartt was founded by Hamilton Carhartt in 1889 in Detroit, Michigan, to make work clothing for manual laborers. The company started with two sewing machines and five workers. Carhartt's first slogan was "Honest value for an honest dollar." The company's initial expansion in the 1890s focused on railroad workers' need for strong and long-lasting work clothes. Carhartt worked closely with local railroad workers to ensure that his work bibs met their needs. Within 20 years of its founding, Carhartt had expanded its facilities into eight other cities, including locations in the United Kingdom and Canada. Carhartt downsized due to declining sales during the Great Depression, but experienced a resurgence in World War II.[4][5][2][6]

Over the years, Carhartt clothing items evolved trademark features intended to extend durability, including the use of heavy-duty thread, reinforcing rivets at stress points, and a variety of durable, high-technology materials resistant to flame, abrasion, stains, and water.[7] Today, Carhartt clothing is commonly found on construction sites, farms and ranches, among other job sites.[4][5]

Carhartt had total sales of $92215125125125 million in 1990. As of 1992, Carhartt sold more than two million jackets per year.[4][5] As of 2013, Carhartt had sales of about $600 million per year.[2]

Products

Carhartt jacket
Carhartt is renowned for its full-cut, wind-resistant, snag-proof, heavy-duty work jackets popular with construction workers, miners, farmers, hunters, and outdoors enthusiasts. Carhartt has also successfully expanded its appeal to general street wear. Carhartt jackets are plain and manufactured in muted colors such as mustard, khaki, and navy blue. They are usually waist-length or three-quarter length. Most are made from relatively stiff 12-ounce cotton canvas with triple-stitched seams. Carhartt also makes pants and overalls with colors and materials that match its jackets. Carhartt jackets are not designed for unusually tall or slender men; they are typically cut wide around the middle to accommodate hefty men.[4][5][2]

In 2007, the company launched the Carhartt for Women[8] line of women's workwear for the fall season.

Collaborations
Collaborations from 2013 also include lines from Adam Kimmel × Carhartt, as well as collections through the A.P.C. × Carhartt line. Both collections used fashion designers, Adam Kimmel and Jean Touitou.[9][10]

In 2014, Carhartt launched a craft beer in cooperation with Michigan brewery New Holland Brewing (The Carhartt Woodsman).[11]

Work in Progress (WIP)
Swiss couple Edwin and Salomée Faeh, designers specializing in denim, discussed representing Carhartt in Europe when they visited the United States in 1989 (the centenary of the company's founding). They started by selling Carhartt's authentic workwear. In 1994, they were granted a license to create their own lines of clothing under the name Carhartt Work in Progress (WIP).[12] WIP is the streetwear version of the Carhartt brand, often marketed as comparable to Stüssy or Supreme.

Carhartt WIP often collaborates with other streetwear brands. An example would be the line of A Bathing Ape X Carhartt WIP camouflage hoodies and jackets.[13] There have also been collaborations with A.P.C., Comme des Garçons, Vetements,[14] Junya Watanabe Pontus Alv's Polar Skate Co, and Gosha Rubchinskiy and Tolya Titaev's skate brand PACCBET.[15] The WIP founders' strategy was to immerse themselves in sub-cultures that interested them and pursue marketing activities that existed in them. This included graffiti, fanzines, skateboarding, hip hop,[12] and a BMX cycle team. Carhartt WIP have a number of stores in Europe (including Berlin, London, Madrid, and Barcelona, Asia, Australia and also in the U.S. (New York City and Los Angeles).[16]

In the London riots of August 2011, the Carhartt WIP outlet store in Hackney in the North of the city was looted as thousands of pounds worth of stock was stolen. The brand released a t-shirt with a photo of their storefront mid-looting.[14]

In 2023 Carhartt WIP announced its collaboration with the design house Marni.[17]

Carhartt owns and operates its manufacturing base in Mexico as well as a number of unionized factories and distribution centers in the United States. Carhartt offers a "Union-Made in USA" line of workwear through its retailers. The company has four factories in the United States. The firm also makes an effort to use domestic suppliers: in 2015, Carhartt purchased 19.5 million pounds of cotton from Georgia, as well as 32 million buttons and 1 million drawcords, both made in Kentucky.[6]

The manufacturing of many of Carhartt's non-core apparel items have been outsourced to countries including China and Mexico. Carhartt requires its international suppliers to be Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) certified.

Sales and advertising
Large regional farm stores like Blain's Farm & Fleet, Fleet Farm and Tractor Supply Company are among the company's most important retailers.[18] Carhartt itself operates retail stores in the U.S. Uniquely, it celebrates the opening of its stores with a sledgehammer smashing a wall instead of a traditional ribbon-cutting ceremony.[19] The company operates a "flagship" store in downtown Detroit in the old Cass Motor Sales building.[6]

Carhartt keeps most of its advertising work in-house, a rare arrangement for a firm its size. Its ads feature actual consumers on actual work sites. In the past Carhartt focused on advertisements in magazines such as Popular Mechanics and American Cowboy with slogans like "As Rugged As The Men Who Wear Them." More recently the company has updated its style and has even partnered with actor Jason Momoa to make ads on things like surfing, hunting as a family tradition, and women making donuts while wearing suspenders.[6]

In popular culture
In 1990, Tommy Boy Records used Carhartt jackets as a promotional vehicle and had its logo embroidered on them.[4] Tommy Boy initially gave away 800 such jackets to "tastemakers and people seen in all the right places."[4] This effort was so successful that the record label eventually started expanding into clothing.[4] Carhartt is popular with hip-hoppers. Rappers like Tupac and Dr. Dre wore Carhartt. Carhartt jackets and their evolution as fashion items were featured prominently at the Bronx Museum of the Arts exhibition entitled "One Planet Under a Groove: Hip-Hop and Contemporary Art" in 2002.[20][6]

Carhartt has become a part of the local culture in Alaska. Talkeetna has held an annual "Carhartt Ball" since 1996.[21] The Alaska State Fair hosts a Carhartt fashion show. Carhartt capitalized on the growth of the working class in Alaska in the late 20th century due to the growth of the oil industry by having its local sales representative, Doug Tweedie, carefully cultivate relationships with the independent stores that dominate the state's relatively isolated retail market. Per-capita sales of the brand's products are higher in Alaska than anywhere else in the world.[6][21][22]
